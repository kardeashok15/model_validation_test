,Comment,Executive Summary,1,,0.0,,0,"This note describes the independent technical validation of the US Installment Loan (USIL)
Model V1 that Money Mart requested from Prescio Consulting. The scope of this exercise is 
limited to only the technical aspect of the modeling and excludes raw data sources, data 
preparation, exploratory data analysis, results, usage, controls and all regulatory and 
governance related independent model validation requirements.
This first iteration of the USIL model is developed by MM for its Centz subsidiary and addresses 
the credit risk of the installment loan portfolio associated with the customers in the US states of
Alabama, Delaware, Idaho, Missouri, New Mexico, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. The 
USIL portfolio is expected to grow to USD 22 MM with the intent of generating 14MM revenue in 
2022. Prescio notes that while a significant effort and technical knowledge was expended in 
applying industry standard ML modeling methodologies, the predictive power of this first 
iteration of the analysis may be severely hampered by multiple modeling data constraints, 
product inhomogeneity and, mismatch between statistical modeling population and the 
prediction population. Given the identical clean input features and data, the models’ AUC (Area 
Under Curve) and Accuracy statistics were close to Prescio’s internal model on a like-to-like 
basis. 
Prescio understands that the predictive scores of this first iteration USIL model would be applied 
as an indicative tool rather than a decision tool, along with TransUnion scores. Prescio is also 
given to understand that additional customer behavioral data, internal data, and different 
external data, along with Centz’s data (when available), will be used in future iterations of the 
USIL model. ",-,-,-,-,-,-
,Comment,Executive Summary,1,Model Purpose and Use,1.1,,0,"The unsecured installment product offered by Aspen had different terms (5-52 months), fixed 
interest rates (100% and 300%), and sizes (USD 0.8K - 5K). Payment terms were weekly, biweekly, semi-monthly and monthly. Aspen had two different product types, new loans and 
refinance loans with no pre-payment penalties. The products were distributed through traditional 
channels (Aspen’s brick and mortar stores) and digital channels (Aspen’s website). Centz will be 
marketing the product with terms ranging from 18-24 months, fixed interest rates (99-139%) and 
loan sizes between USD 2.5 K to USD 5K. Payment terms will be bi-weekly, semi-monthly and 
monthly. Centz will be distributing the products through traditional channels (Centz and MM 
brick and mortar stores) and digitally through its website. Centz is expected to have only one 
product type, new loan with no prepayment penalty. 
Finding 1: As noted, the product marketed by Aspen is different than the product planned to be 
marketed by Centz. Additionally, Centz’s product does not have a refinance option as Aspen’s 
product did.
Finding 2: Prescio finds that the Aspen’s loan data are not homogeneous in terms of size, rates 
and duration. 
MM is aware of the differences but does not have sufficient Centz data for the current modeling 
exercise. Prescio understands that MM does not plan to have a refinance option for this product
in the future",-,-,-,-,-,-
